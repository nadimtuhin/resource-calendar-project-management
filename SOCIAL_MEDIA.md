**Title:** [Show OSS] Resource Calendar - Visual project management tool for teams

Hi r/opensource!

I wanted to share my latest open-source project: Resource Calendar.

It's a visual tool for managing team resources and project allocation. Think of it as a simplified resource planning tool that runs entirely in your browser.

**Why I built it:** I needed a simple way to visualize my team's workload without the complexity (and cost) of enterprise tools.

**What makes it special:**
- No backend required - runs entirely in browser with local storage
- Clean, modern UI built with React and Tailwind
- Visual indicators for resource utilization
- Simple to deploy - just static files
- MIT licensed

Perfect for small teams, freelancers, or anyone who needs better visibility into resource allocation.

Contributions welcome! Looking for feedback on features you'd like to see.

### r/reactjs

**Title:** Built a resource management calendar with React + TypeScript - seeking feedback!

Hey React devs!

Just wrapped up Resource Calendar, a project management tool built with:
- React 18.3 with hooks
- TypeScript for full type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for development
- Custom hooks for state management

**Interesting React patterns used:**
- Custom hook (`useResourceCalendar`) for all business logic
- Local storage persistence with useEffect
- Modular component architecture
- Fully typed with TypeScript interfaces

The entire state management is done with React hooks and local storage - no Redux/MobX needed!

Would love feedback on the code structure and any suggestions for improvements.
